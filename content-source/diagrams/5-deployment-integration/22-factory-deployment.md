## 🚧 Coming Soon

This diagram will explain how to deploy strategies using factory contracts for standardization and efficiency.

### What It Will Cover:

- Factory pattern benefits
- Parameter validation
- Strategy deployment
- Initialization process
- Registration with vault
- Clone vs full deployment

### Narrative Preview:

*"Bob wants to deploy an Aave USDC strategy. Instead of deploying from scratch, he calls the AaveStrategyFactory. The factory validates parameters, deploys the strategy, initializes it, and registers it with the vault - all in one transaction..."*
