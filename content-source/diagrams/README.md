This directory contains visual guides and diagrams to help understand the Octant v2 protocol.

## 📊 Available Diagrams

### [Octant v2 Visual Guide](./octant-v2-visual-guide.md)
**10 comprehensive diagrams covering the entire protocol**

A complete visual tutorial with Alice/Bob style narratives explaining:

1. **Basic User Deposit & Withdrawal Flow** - How users interact with vaults
2. **Yield Generation & Distribution Flow** - How yield is earned and split
3. **Multi-Strategy Vault Allocation** - How funds are distributed across strategies
4. **Yield Donating Strategy** - Discrete profit donation mechanism
5. **Yield Skimming Strategy** - LST appreciation capture
6. **Dragon Router & Allocation Flow** - How yield flows to projects
7. **Quadratic Funding Vote & Distribution** - Democratic voting system
8. **Proposal Lifecycle** - Project funding workflow from creation to redemption
9. **Lockup & Rage Quit Mechanism** - Commitment periods and emergency exits
10. **Trader DCA Mechanism** - Automated, random-timing token swaps

## 🛠️ Using These Diagrams

All diagrams are written in Mermaid syntax and can be:
- Rendered automatically on GitHub
- Embedded in GitBook, Docusaurus, MkDocs
- Converted to SVG/PNG for presentations
- Used as storyboards for video tutorials

## 📝 Diagram Format

Each diagram includes:
- **Narrative**: A story explaining the flow (e.g., "Alice deposits $10,000...")
- **Visual Flow**: Mermaid diagram showing step-by-step interactions
- **Key Points**: Bullet points summarizing important concepts

## 🔄 Contributing

To add new diagrams:
1. Use Mermaid syntax (sequenceDiagram, flowchart, stateDiagram-v2)
2. Include a narrative with character names (Alice, Bob, Carol, etc.)
3. Add key points summarizing the mechanism
4. Update this README with a link
